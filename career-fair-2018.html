      <h5>HKUST Career Mosaic is HKUST campus-wide bi-annual weeklong job fair, where students are available to meet participating employers face to face. This was vivovii's second time participating in HKUST career fair and similar to last year, I was also responsible for the event from concept to execution including but not limited to booth setup, logistics, planning, budgeting and&nbsp;design.</h5></div>
    
    <h6>Challenge</h6>
    
    <div class="margin150">
    <h5>My objective of the company's participation is to spark HKUST students' interest in joining the company by knowing more about the product. Not only do we want to spark student's interest but we also want to attract the right candidates who has the same attutide and values as our company to join and increase the team's standard and productivity. But this year, as it is the company's second time in attending the career fair, I needed to up my standards and make an improvement to last year's concept and&nbsp;design.

        <div class="caption">With last year’s success, we had returned to HKUST Mosaic Career Fair 2018 to recruit and create brand awareness for the company. Compared to last year, the product and branding had matured with more design assets to work with. I had chosen to promote self-awareness as the theme for the career fair because I believe that being self-aware can help you understand yourself and people more and in return you are able to make improvements and make better decisions in the&nbsp;future.
        <br /><br />

In design, there are often more than one way to communicate an idea. My challenge was to choose one that is feasible with the available resources that I had. I had thought of making an interactive mirror, a mood changing installation and so on but all of these requires too much time and resources. So I started looking at what was around me and an inspiration came. To use the mobile app as the medium to communicate what our product fundamentally does and from that, to continue to educate about the product and&nbsp;company.

		<div class="container">
        <div class="caption">To refine the idea, I started looking through the list of assessments that the app already had and chose based on these criteria: short, interesting and fun. The assessment that was chosen is called, ‘Thinking Style’, with that, I had further developed my design idea around the assessment. The assessment is about knowing what kind of thinker you are; if you are a reflective thinker, an intuitive thinker or a mix of both. Knowing a little bit more about yourself, is one step closer to communicate and understand people who are different than&nbsp;you. 
        
        <br /><br />

To make the whole experience a bit more interesting and to satisfy the scientific aspect of the company, we collected the results that were completed by the students and displayed it on the monitors to serve as an interesting piece of information that would allow students at HKUST know the popular thinking style at school. And interestingly, not to our surprise, the top score is ‘Reflective Thinker’. A reflective thinker is someone who makes their decision cautiously and logically, not being effected by their emotions.

        <div class="caption">In order to collect data real-time and have it displayed live on-site, I liaised with the iOS developer to setup the content through CMS and he would make the information shown on the display. I also handed over the design assets to the front-end developer with coding examples found online to best communicate to him what I envisioned since this project can’t take too much of the engineer’s&nbsp;time. 
        
        <br /><br />

Here is the set-up of the booth with a few new elements and improvements from last year. Some of the changes are a new roll-up banner, job description handouts, post-it notes as swag, name badges, and table&nbsp;dressing.
