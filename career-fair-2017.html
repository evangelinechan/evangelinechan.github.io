        <div class="caption">To come up with an idea for the career fair, I sat down and analyzed the company’s branding assets back in 2017 and tried to focus on what students would find appealing but connect it back to our company’s purpose. I played with a few ideas of giving away swags with just our company’s name on it or to give them a simple brochure but those felt too conventional and wouldn’t spark people’s interest. As I went through the files, I noticed the 7 domains. The 7 domains are the 7 categories of which vivovii believes contributes to well-bring; personal growth, emotional well-being, relationships, physical health, education & career, financial matters, and leisure. I chose the 7 domains because not only does it speak about the company and the product but also because the design is colourful and iconic which appeals to youth.

        <div class="caption">After researching all the possible swags that I could make, here are the final 3; dice stress ball, socks and water bottles. I had mocked them up for better visualization of what it would look like and if the concept makes sense. After sitting down with the COO, we had agreed on proceeding with the glass water bottle as it is functional, it has a positive connotation of being health conscious, it stays within budget and the design can be quite flexible. To connect the relationship between the water bottles and domains, I had came up with motivational quotes that represents the 7 domains as a gentle reminder for the user.</div>

		<div class="container">
        <div class="caption">With the booth dimensions and information given from the university, I had started conceptualizing the booth setup. The booth space allowed for 2 roll-up banners and a table. I had aimed to make the booth as noticeable as possible to create brand awareness in order to educate and reach out to as many people as possible. After thinking and rethinking how I could present the bottles, I have decided to put it into 7 stand-alone boxes and in each box would be its on domain. To make it more obvious, I had placed LED lights inside to intrigue students to ask about who we are and what we are about. To keep the scientific element to our booth, we had make it into a poll to keep track of which domain HKUST students is most interested in. The result, education and careers.
