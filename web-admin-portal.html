	<h3>Admin portal</h3>
    
	<h6>Details</h6>
    
<div class="margin150">
      <h5>Potential clients requested to have a functional platform where the organization would have full control of managing content, teams and members without the help of external resources. The solution, an admin portal. The admin portal will allow the organization admin to add/remove members, teams and control the visibility of content for each team. This change will then be reflected instantly in the CMS and mobile/web app. Having an admin portal for clients, not only  increase the flexibilty of managing content within their organization but it will also help decrease the  company's time in managing our client's change requests and content-to-team&nbsp;management.</h5></div>
    
    <h6>Challenge</h6>
    
    <div class="margin150">
    <h5>With the company's existing CMS, it was very hard for the user to understand how the system works. Each link in the CMS were designed to do one operation so it was troublesome for the user if they have multiple steps to perform; the user needs to memorize how the system works in order to perform their tasks. To simplify CMS and to have a platform dedicated to our client's needs, the company decided to take out a section of the CMS and further develop it into an admin portal. My main objective was to keep the functionality of the existing platform but enhancing the user interface and experience so that even if its the user's first time on the platform, they would be able to achieve their goal intuitively without the help of another&nbsp;party.</h5>

        <div class="caption">As our CMS is an internal platform used by a few, I was able to interview the COO and Development Team Lead about their experiences with CMS' performance as they were the ones who understands and uses CMS the most. Some pain points that were&nbsp;identified: <br/><br/>
        1. <b>Navigation</b> - It is unclear to the user where to go in order to perform a series of tasks&nbsp;successfully. <br/>
        2. <b>Flow</b> - After each operation is performed, the flow stops which then requires the user to process manually what to do&nbsp;next.<br/>
        3. <b>Relationship panel</b> - It was not clear to the user the structure between how content is assigned within the&nbsp;organization.<br/>

        <div class="caption">Once I have determined the functionalities of each page from a design standpoint, I had liaised with the engineering team to ensure that all operations are achieveable and an estimation for each function were given from the engeineering team. Then we would schedule the overall project pipeline to ensure that our project could be delivered before the deadline. If not, we would discuss the priority of the features and backlog anything that are "nice to have", meaning, as a team we had make the agreement that these features adds value for the user but it would not make the product dysfunctional without it, therefore, lets get back to it once we have the fundamentals&nbsp;built.<br /><br />
        For this project, I was fortunate to have our Junior Graphic Designer, Jeorgialyn Sy, and Junior UI/UX designer, Gillian Chiu, to help distribute my workload. The plan was to have Jeorgialyn help me some icon designs and Gillian with taking over the listing pages and the notification pages of admin portal. So after planning the overall project pipeline with the engineering team, I liaised with the UI/UX designer to make sure that our overall design deadlines are not in conflict and that my proposed plan would be achieveable within the given timeline.
