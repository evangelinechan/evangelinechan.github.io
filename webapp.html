      <h5>With the mobile application deployed and operational, the next phase of the company's product development was to have a web-based application that mimics the mobile app so that users can have access  from any computer as long as they are able to connect to the Internet. This effort is to support clients who has a strict rule with using mobile phones at work so that content would still be readily available to users if they don't have access to mobile&nbsp;phones.</h5></div>
    
    <h6>Challenge</h6>
    
    <div class="margin150">
    <h5>The main challenge and objective for this project is to have web app ready and deployed in 3 months of time so that mobile and web app can be in-sync. As the two platforms is different in its native environment, I had to design with the different technical constraints in mind. The scope of the project included designing login/authentication, create account, terms and conditions, assessment, user flow, tracking progress, error pages and implementing new&nbsp;features.</h5>

        <div class="caption">With the existing client facing mobile application, I was fortunate that a lot of the thinking had been done but there was still a lot of reconsiderations that was needed to be made so that our users won't feel a disconnection while switching between mobile and web as they might use it concurrently. 
        <br />
        <br />
        An example of the factors that I had to heavily consider that is only native to a web browser was the back button, forward button and the refresh button. These buttons in an native mobile app could be disabled, hidden or removed, however, these buttons are consistently in place across all popular web browsers. As these buttons cannot be customized or removed on web, the web flow will need to be changed. I had to consider if it would make sense for the user to go directly back to its previous page or would it be better going&nbsp;elsewhere?<br/><br/>

        <div class="caption">Since the two platforms has its own technical constraints, the flow was needed to be changed in order to adapt to the different environment. In order to communicate these changes, I had used the UX flow substantially to note down all the requirements and defining differences between the mobile app and web app. Once noted down, the engineering team will take note and analyze if it is feasible to complete the project in the given time frame. If not, the engineer and I will sit down and discuss alternative solutions to make it&nbsp;work.

        As part of the project plan, we have broken down web app to be developed in different stages focusing on releasing the main core functionalities and content first. After the initial release, the latter releases are feature focused. Since the project plan had been broken down, at the end of each phase, the engineering team and I would reconnect and have a thorough run through of what was developed. During this session, I would ensure that the implementation of the product is aligned with my design deliverables as well as making sure that all the business requirements and objectives are met. Changes that were needed to made were documented and applied so that we could move onto QA testing before&nbsp;deployment.
